 <h1>How coffee came to India? History of Chikmagalur Coffee.</h1>
        <h4>There are many myths and stories about coffee's voyage to India. The fascinating story opens with Baba Budan, a Sufi saint who travelled to Mecca in the 17th century on a pilgrimage. Baba Budan decided to bring the alluring flavours of coffee to his own country after learning about them while on his travels. However, Yemen, where coffee was mostly grown, strongly forbade the export of coffee beans. Unaffected by the limitations, Baba Budan undertook a risky mission in which he successfully smuggled seven coffee beans back to India by hiding them in his beard. 
            Baba Budan planted these priceless beans in his garden close to a cave in Chandragiri when he returned to his birthplace, the charming town of Chikmagalur located in the Western Ghats. Originally known as Chandra Dona, the hill is now referred to as Baba Budan Giri in honour of the saint. By introducing the mystical world of coffee to India, Baba Budan's bold action profoundly altered the agricultural landscape of India. Chikmagalur's coffee plantations were built on land that the then-Maharaja of Mysore Krishnaraja Wodeyar 111 donated. It also established the groundwork for the rich coffee history that Chikmagalur and the nation would later cherish. This marked the commencement of coffee farming in India. </h4>

            <h1>What kind of coffee is grown in Chikmagalur?</h1>
            <h4>Arabica coffee, renowned for its delicate flavour and alluring aroma, is predominantly grown in Chikmagalur.  The Chikmagalur district in Karnataka, India, had more than 55,000 hectares under Arabica coffee farming in the fiscal year 2022 (1). Arabica beans thrive in Chikmagalur's higher elevations and cooler temperatures resulting in a rich, well-balanced cup of coffee. 


                Coffee farming benefits greatly from Chikmagalur's geographic location, fertile soil, and favourable climate. With an elevation between 2,800 and 6,000 feet above sea level, the region enjoys a moderate and pleasant climate all year round. The high elevation, ideal cool weather and monsoon provide the perfect conditions for growing coffee plants.
                
                Coffee from higher elevations are considered to be world's truly awesome coffee. Why coffee from high elevations taste better? Higher altitudes with cooler temperatures cause the growth cycle to be delayed, allowing the beans to mature for a longer period of time. This results in coffee that is significantly fuller, richer, and more flavorful.
                
                Here is Panduranga Coffee’s 100% Plantation AAA Arabica Coffee “Mysore Nuggets”. A coffee so exquisite that it was the only coffee allowed in the royal palaces.
